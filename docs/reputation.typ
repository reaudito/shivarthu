#strong[🌍 Positive Externality]
Any action that contributes positively to the world is considered a _positive externality_.

Examples:
- Planting trees or cleaning up trash
- Sharing knowledge or teaching others
- Building open-source tools
- Supporting local communities

You create impact → The world gets better → You get rewarded.

---

#strong[🎲 Score Schelling Game]

A decentralized way to measure impact fairly.

How it works:
- Users submit their actions (e.g., “Volunteered 5 hours”).
- Randomly selected peers validate them.
- Honest validators earn rewards.
- Cheaters lose stake.

Over time, this creates a reliable _impact score_.

---

#strong[📈 Reputation System]

Your validated score builds your _reputation_.

More reputation means:
- More influence in governance
- Greater voting power
- Access to higher-level decisions

Reputation is earned — not bought.

---

#strong[🗳️ Voting with Reputation]

Representatives are elected based on community trust.

- Higher reputation = more voting weight
- Vote for people you trust to make good decisions
- Representatives propose and fund public goods/projects

This ensures that only those trusted by the community lead impactful change.

---

#strong[🏗️ Funding Projects]

Once elected, representatives:
- Propose new initiatives
- Allocate funds to verified needs
- Report transparently back to the community

Projects can range from:
- Education programs
- Environmental restoration
- Tech for social good
- Healthcare access

---
