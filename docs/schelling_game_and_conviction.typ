= What is Schelling Game?

== The Schelling Game

- Schelling Game uses a _game-theoretic model_ where participants are incentivized to vote honestly because:
  - They are rewarded if their vote matches the majority.
  - They are penalized if they vote differently.

== How It Works

- Jurors are randomly selected from token holders.
- More tokens more chances of being selected.
- Jurors review evidence and cast votes.
- Honest jurors win rewards; dishonest ones lose tokens.
- This creates a self-correcting system that converges on truth.

- _Conviction Voting_: voters lock tokens over time â†’ gain more voting power.
- Long-term stakeholders have stronger influence.

== Why Use It?

- Encourages long-term thinking.
- Balances power between large and small token holders.

= Example Scenario

Letâ€™s say thereâ€™s a proposal to fund a new project in a DAO:

== With Conviction Voting:
- Alice locks 100 DOT for 4 weeks â†’ her vote carries more weight.
- Bob casts a quick vote with 50 DOT â†’ less influence.

== With Schelling Game:
- Jurors are randomly selected from token holders. More tokens more chances of being selected.
- Jurors are financially incentivized to vote correctly.

- _Schelling Game_ uses a _Schelling Point mechanism_ to ensure honest evidence review.
- _Conviction Voting_ empowers long-term commitment in decentralized governance.
